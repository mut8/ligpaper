\section*{Results}
\subsection*{Initial litter chemistry}
Initial litter chemistry of the four sites (Achenkirch, AK, Klausenleopoldsdorf, KL, Ossiach, OS, Schottenwald, SW), measured 14 days after incubation, is presented in supplemental table \ref{initstoech}. C:N ratios varied between 41:1 and 58:1 and C:P ratios between 700:1 and 1300:1, while N:P ratios ranged between 15:1 and 30:1. No significant changes occurred during litter incubation except a slight decrease of the C:N ratio (41.8:1 to 37.4:1) found in the most active litter type (SW) after 15 months. Fe concentrations were more than twice as high for OS (approx. 450 ppm) than for other litter types (approx. 200 ppm). Litter Mn also was highly variable between litter types, ranging between 170 and 2130 ppm. Changes of micro-nutrient concentrations during litter incubation were significant, but in all cases \textless 15\% of the initial concentration. In initial litter, lignin accounted for 28.9-31.2\% and carbohydrates for 25.9-29.2\% of the total peak area of all pyrolysis products.

\subsection*{Mass loss, respiration and soluble organic carbon}

Litter mass loss was not significant after 2 weeks and 3 months, and significant for 2 litter from two sites after 6 months. After 15 months, litter mass loss was significant for all collection sites, and ranged between 5 and 12 \% of the initial dry mass, and was strongly correlated to litter N content (R=0.794, p\textless 0.001). Detailed results were reported by \cite{Mooshammer2011}.

Highest respiration rates were measured at the first measurement after 14 days incubation (150-350 \textmu g CO$_2$-C d$^{-1}$ g$^{-1}$ litter-C), which dropped to 75 to 100 \textmu g CO$_2$-C d$^{-1}$ g$^{-1}$ litter-C after 3 months. After 6 and 15 months, respiration rates for AK and OS further decreased, while SW and KL showed a second maximum in respiration after 6 months (fig \ref{fig:enz}). Accumulated respiration was strongly correlated to litter mass loss after 15 months (r=0.738, p\textless 0.001, n=20).

Soluble organic carbon concentrations decreased between the first three harvests (14 days to 6 months), and strongly increased to 15 months (from 0.1 to 0.7 mg C g$^{-1}$  d.w. to 1.5 to 4 mg C g$^{-1}$ d.w. after 15 months, fig. \ref{fig:enz}). After 14 days and 3 months, the highest soluble organic C concentrations were found in SW litter followed by AK. Soluble organic C concentrations were weakly correlated with litter N content after 14 days (r=0.69, p\textless 0.001, n=20) and after 3 months (r = 0.65, p\textless 0.01, n=20), but strictly correlated after 6 months (r=0.85, p\textless 0.001, n=20) and 15 months (r=0.90, p\textless 0.001, n=20).

\subsubsection*{Potential enzyme activities}
Within each time point, all potential extracellular enzyme activities were correlated with litter N and actual respiration rates(all R\textgreater 0.8, p\textless 0.001, n=20). Cellulase activity increased from the first harvest onwards to 15 months, with a small depression after 6 months (Fig. \ref{fig:enz}), phenoloxidase and peroxidase activities reached their maximum between 3 and 6 months (fig. \ref{fig:enz}). For all enzymes and at all time points, SW showed the highest and AK the lowest activities. Differences between these two sites were more pronounced in cellulase activity (SW 10x higher than AK) than in oxidative enzymes (SW 4x higher). Conversely, the phenoloxidase/cellulase ratio was highest for AK and lowest for SW at all time points and decreased during litter decomposition (fig. \ref{fig:enz}).

\subsubsection*{Microbial biomass abundance and community composition}
Microbial biomass contents ranged from 0.5 to 6 mg C g$^{-1}$ d.w., 0.05 to 0.55 mg N g$^{-1}$ d.w. and 0.05 to 0.35 mg P g$^{-1}$ litter d.w (fig. \ref{fig:mb}). After an initial increase in microbial biomass, in KL and OS microbial biomass remained constant after 3 months while AK and SW showed further microbial biomass growth reaching a maximum of microbial C and N contents after 6 months (AK also for P). Microbial C:N ratios ranged between 6:1 and 18:1, C:P ratios between 8:1 and 35:1, and N:P ratios between 0.5:1 and 3.5:1 (fig. \ref{fig:mb}).

Microbial biomass was stoichiometrically homeostatic during the first 6 months (no or negative correlations between microbial C:N:P and litter C:N:P, see also \cite{Mooshammer2011}), but after 15 months (microbial C:N:P ratios were significantly and positively correlated to resource stoichiometry: R=0.53-0.64, all p\textless 0.002). The homeostatic regulation coefficients \cite{Sterner2002} were H\textsubscript{C:P}=1.68, H\textsubscript{C:N}=2.01, and H\textsubscript{N:P}=2.29 after 15 month incubation. Microbial C:N ratios after 3 and 6 months were within a tighly constrained range, 14.5:1 to 18.2:1 after 3 months and 6.9:1 to 9.0:1 after 6 months, but significantly different between the two sampling events. In contrast, microbial C:P and N:P ratios were less constrained, with the highest variance between litter from different sites after 3 months of incubation (fig. \ref{fig:mb}).

Metaproteome analysis yielded between 451 and 1113 (average 639) assigned spectra sample (one replicate per collection site after 14 days, 3, 6, and 15 months). Only spectra assigned to bacteria or fungi were used for community profiling. Fungal proteins were dominant in all litter types at all stages, but most prominent in SW and least pronounced in  AK. Fungi:bacteria (F:B) protein abundance ratios were highest after 14 days (5 to 12) and decreased during litter decomposition (1.7 to 3 after 15 months, see fig. \ref{fig:f2b}). The large initial differences in F:B ratios between litter from different sites decreased during decomposition. In addition, F:B ratios were measured on a DNA basis (qPCR) the results showing a similar pattern but with a much larger fungal DNA dominance (F:B ratios between 10-180). F:B ratios were highly correlated between protein- and log-transformed DNA-based estimates (r=0.785, p\textless 0.001, n=20).

Fungal communities were dominated by Ascomycetes, with smaller contributions by Basidiomycetes (<5\% of fungal protein).  Among the fungal classes found, Sordariomycetes and Eurotiomycetes were most abundant with further contributions of Dothideomycetes, Leothiomycetes and Saccharomycetes (fig. \ref{fig:metaprot_barplot}). Bacteria were dominated by Proteobacteria (mainly $\gamma$, declining, and $\alpha$- and $\beta$-Proteobacteria, increasing with litter decomposition) with minor contribution of Actinomycetes and Bacterioidetes (both increasing) and Thermotogae (decreasing, fig. \ref{fig:metaprot_barplot}).

\subsection*{Pyrolysis-GC/MS and Lignin content}
In total 128 pyrolysis products were detected, quantified, identified and assigned to their substances of origin (suppl. tab. \ref{tab:phprod} -\ref{tab:nprod}). We found only minor changes in the relative concentration of litter pyrolysis products during decomposition, and differences between sites were small but well preserved during decomposition. However, the high precision and reproducibility of pyrolysis GC/MS analysis of litter allowed tracing small changes in lignin and carbohydrate abundance during decomposition. Lignin-derived compounds made up between 29 and 31 \% relative peak area (TIC) in initial litter, and increased by up to 3 \%. The increase occured almost exclusively during the first 6 months. Carbohydrate-derived pyrolysis products accounted for 26 to 29 \% in initial litter and decreased by up to 2.6 \% within 15 months of incubation. The initial (pyrolysis-based) lignin:carbohydrate indices (LCI) were highly similar between litter from different collection sites, ranging between 0.517 and 0.533 (Fig. 4). During decomposition, the LCI increased by up to 9 \% of the initial value. The highest increase was found in SW litter, while LCI slightly decreased in AK litter. All significant changes in LCI  occurred within the first 6 months (fig. \ref{fig:lci}). As differences in lignin and carbohydrate contents between 0-3 and 3-6 months were not significant, we analyzed differences for two time intervals, i.e. between 0-6 months and 6-15 months.

During the first 6 months, between one and 6 \% of the initial lignin pool and between 4 and 17\% of the initial carbohydrate pool were degraded (Fig. \ref{fig:degr}). Lignin decomposition was highest in AK and KL litter, while microbial communities of KL, OS and SW litter decomposed carbohydrates faster. Lignin preference values (\% lignin decomposed : \%carbohydrates decomposed) were lowest in SW and highest in AK litter (Figure 5). In AK litter, lignin macromolecules were 50 \% more likely to be decomposed than carbohydrates, while in SW litter carbohydrates were 10 times more likely to be decomposed (fig. \ref{fig:degr}). Between 6 and 15 months, no further accumulation of lignin occurred. Lignin and carbohydrates were both degraded at the same rate and their relative concentrations remained constant between 6 and 15 months (fig. \ref{fig:degr}).

\subsection*{Correlations between lignin and carbohydrate decomposition and litter chemistry, microbial community and decomposition processes}

Relationships between lignin and carbohydrate degradation, litter chemistry, microbial biomass and decomposition processes were tested after 6 and 15 months (tables \ref{corrtable} and \ref{corrtable2}) including data presented by \cite{Mooshammer2011} and \cite{Leitner2011}. After 6 months, we found that the ratio of lignin/cellulose degradation was positively correlated with the ratio of phenoloxidase : cellulase (R=0.599, p=0.005, n=20) and peroxidase : cellulase (R=0.734 p\textless 0.001, n=20). Carbohydrate decomposition was positively correlated with litter N content, and negatively with litter C:N ratios and litter-microbial C:N imbalances. In contrast, lignin decomposition was negatively correlated to litter P, but positively with litter C:P and N:P ratios, and litter-microbial C:P and N:P imbalances (fig. \ref{fig:cor1}). After 15 months, the ratio of lignin : carbohydrate decomposition was no longer related to stoichiometry or elemental composition any more. Most interestingly, lignin and carbohydrate decomposition exhibited the same controls, being positively correlated to soluble organic C, litter N and litter P (table \ref{corrtable2}) between 6 and 15 months. Mass loss and accumulated respiration were positively correlated to lignin and carbohydrate decomposition (table \ref{corrtable2}), a pattern that we did not find for lignin decomposition in the early decomposition phase (table \ref{corrtable}). Protein abundance F:B ratios were negatively correlated to the ratios of lignin : cellulose decomposition and to LCI change during the first 6 months, pointing to bacterial engagement in lignin decomposition. In contrast, both lignin and carbohydrate decomposition rates, were positively correlated with F:B ratios after 15 months, pointing to fungal dominance of both lignin and carbohydrate decompostion. No correlation between F:B ratio and the ratio of lignin : cellulose decomposition was found in this later period (fig. \ref{fig:f2b}).


To asses the interaction between litter chemistry, microbial community and degradation processes, we conducted a correspondence analysis (CA) of the metaprotomen data (relative protein abundances, fig. \ref{fig:metaprotpca}). The results indicate that incubations time (i.e. succession) is the dominant factor controlling the microbial community, with samples collected at the first (14 days) and the last (15 month) sampling grouping closely together, while litter quality (i.e. elemental stoichiometry of litter collected at different sites) had a higher impact after 3 and 6 months. The first factor (CA 1), which explained 35.7 \% of the total variance, separates litter sampled after 15 months (positive values) from litter sampled earlier (negative values). Consequently, CA 1 was also positively correlated to incubation time and negatively to litter carbon content (i.e. decreasing C:N ratios during decomposition) . A number of bacterial taxa (Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Alpha- and Betaproteobacteria), and two fungal classes (Leotiomycetes and Tremellomycetes) were positively correlated to CA1 i.e. increased in abundance towards 15 months, while Cyanobacteria, Epsilonproteobacteria and Saccharomycetes were negatively correlated. CA 2, which explained 26.0 \% variance, separated litter sampled within the first 6 months. Dothideomycetes and Sordariomycetes were positively and Gammaproteobacteria negatively correlated to this factor, which also correlated to the F:B protein abundance ratio. Litter collected 14 days after inoculation have the highest scores on CA 2, while sites with active lignin degradation within the first 6 months (AK, KL) have the most negative scores. The axis was furthermore correlated to the microbial biomass P content and C:P and N:P imbalances (and free NH\textsubscript{4}\textsuperscript{+}, not shown). For samples analyzed after 6 months, where direct comparison to lignin degradation rates was possible, significant correlations to CA 2 were found for lignin : carbohydrate degradation (r=-0.97, p=0.028), \% Lignin loss : \% Carbon loss (r=-0.96, p=0.040) and  LCI increase (r=0.973, p=0.027), even though the number of independent samples was very low (n=4). Differences in CA2 strongly decreased after 15 months, suggesting that the differences in the microbial community found within the first 6 months were siminished with succession of the decomposer community. Litter N and P contents were not correlated to either factor, although differences in resource quality evidently affected community composition after 3 and 6 months, as can be seen in the differences in the microbial communities as observed in CA 2. Correlation of CA factors with litter stoichiometry, and microbial stoichiometry, and the abundance of the analyzed taxa are provided in supplemental table \ref{catab}.
